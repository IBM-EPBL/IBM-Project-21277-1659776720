            Tuvalu responds to the countrys first community transmission of COVID-19.After more than two-and-a-half years without any community transmission of COVID-19, Tuvalu is now responding to its first community cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners are supporting the Pacific island nations emergency response. 

            Routine surveillance uncovered two cases on 2 November 2022 that could not be linked to recent travel, making Tuvalu the last full WHO Member State in the Western Pacific Region to experience community transmission of COVID-19.  
            
            The Ministry of Health, Social Welfare and Gender Affairs has since detected a total of 443 cases as of 9 November following the rapid launch of a widespread contact tracing campaign in collaboration with the Tuvalu Red Cross. To date, almost all of these cases are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms and have been asked to isolate and recover at home, with just two cases currently hospitalized. Vaccination rates are high, with 97% of the eligible population (5 years and above) having received at least two doses of COVID-19 vaccine and 81% of the eligible population having also received at least one booster. 
            
            This is it the moment we have all been preparing for said Lily Tangisia Faavae, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Social Welfare and Gender Affairs. “We have been blessed with having much more time to prepare than the rest of the world and to launch our response based on more in-depth knowledge of the virus and what works against it. That, plus the fact that we have been able to benefit from the life-saving protection of COVID-19 vaccines, gives us a huge advantage.
            
            However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us over the coming weeks to protect the vulnerable members of our communities. Our health workers, Red Cross and government colleagues are already out there responding, but we all have a role to play in keeping each other safe. We are a team, all 11,000 of us in Tuvalu, and we all need to ensure that we are fully vaccinated and that we carry out all the other protective measures such as wearing our masks, cleaning our hands regularly, limiting time in crowded places and staying at least 6 feet away from other people. It's also important that we all know what to do if one of our loved ones gets sick. Together, we can get through this and save countless lives.A recent study revealed that people earlier infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus still benefit from vaccination against COVID-19, gaining 60% to 94% protection against reinfection.

            Data on vaccinations and infections from all Danish registrations were analysed for the study, which was published in the journal PLOS Medicine. The data included all Danes, who tested positive for the virus or got a vaccination between January 2020 and January 2022.More than 200,000 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during each of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves were examined by researchers at Statens Serum Institut in Denmark.

            Vaccination provided protection against reinfection
            
            According to their research, vaccination provided up to 71% protection against reinfection for those with prior illnesses during the Alpha period, 94 % protection during the Delta period.

C.V. Ananda Bose was on November 23 sworn in as the Governor of West Bengal. The Governor was administered the oath by Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court Prakash Shrivastava at Raj Bhawan, Kolkata.Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari was not present at the swearing-in ceremony. Mr. Bose has taken over responsibilities from Manipur Governor La. Ganesan who assumed charge of the State on July 18 when Jagdeep Dhankhar was elected Vice-President of India.

Mr. Bose is a 1977-batch former officer of the Indian Administrative Services who has served as the Secretary of Government of India and Chief Secretary to State Governments as well as University Vice-Chancellor.The appointment of new West Bengal Governor comes at a time when serious differences between Raj Bhawan and State Government have come to fore in several States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Till recently, West Bengal too witnessed a similar standoff between Raj Bhawan and the State Government.

Meanwhile, the absence of Leader of Opposition at the swearing in ceremony has triggered a controversy. Mr. Adhikari had taken to social media raising objection at the seating arrangement at the swearing-in ceremony. The BJP leader said that the chair which was designated to him was next to two BJP turncoats who have defected to Trinamool Congress (TMC) after the 2021 Assembly polls.
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi looks like "Saddam Hussein", the former Iraqi dictator and it would have been better had he turned his appearance like Sardar Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru or Mahatma Gandhi.Hitting back, senior Congress leader Manish Tewari said the Assam CM was sounding like a "petty troll". Mr. Gandhi has been seen sporting a beard during the ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra, a mass contact initiative of the Congress.During a public rally in Ahmedabad on November 22, Mr. Sarma said, "I just saw that his looks have also changed. I said in a TV interview a few days back that there is nothing wrong with his new look. But if you have to change the looks, at least make it like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel or even Jawaharlal Nehru will do. It is better if it looks like Gandhiji. But why is your face turning into Saddam Hussein?" This is because the Congress culture is not closer to Indian people. Their culture is closer to people who have never understood India, Mr. Sarma claimed.

He further claimed that Mr. Gandhi (during the Bharat Jodo Yatra) preferred not to visit States such as Himachal Pradesh, where elections were held recently, and poll-bound Gujarat, and was instead focussing on States where there were no polls because he knew that he will be defeated wherever he visits.

Mr. Sarma said he saw (Narmada Bachao Andolan) activist Medha Patkar with Mr. Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra in Maharashtra.

"She is the one who conspired to deprive Gujarat of water. Had she succeeded, the Narmada water would never have reached Kutch. Rahul Gandhi is doing Bharat Jodo Yatra with such people who never wanted Gujarat's development," the Assam Chief Minister claimed.

            About seven European nations were forced to abandon their plans to wear the 'OneLove armband', which is aimed at promoting diversity, after FIFA threatened to impose sanctions. The trouble has now appeared to escalate further with the German Football Association (German FA) planning to take FIFA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over ban on rainbow armbands. The World Cup rules require captains’ armbands must be authorised and provided by FIFA. German captain Manuel Neuer is unlikely to wear the rainbow armband during Germany vs Japan match on Wednesday following the FIFA threat. 

Qatar 2022: German Football Federation sends strong message to FIFA 
According to The Guardian, DFB’s spokesperson Stefan Simon confirmed to the tabloid Bild that it had lodged a case over the legal validity of FIFA's decision at the CAS in Lausanne. He hoped that the ban is overturn around the time Germany plays its second match against Spain on Sunday, allowing captain Manuel Neuer’s to wear the OneLove armband without being penalised.

“FIFA has forbidden us from using a symbol of diversity and human rights. It said the ban would be linked to massive penalties (in the nature of) sporting sanctions without concretising exactly what it meant. The DFB is keen to clarify whether FIFA’s procedure is in fact legitimate,” he said. 

Following the tussle with FIFA over the 'OneLove armband' during FIFA World Cup, the DFB lost one of its commercial partners on Tuesday after German supermarket chain REWE ended its sponsorship deal over the armband dispute. REWE chief executive Lionel Souque, in his statement, said, "We stand for diversity and football is diversity. The scandalous behaviour of FIFA is for me as the CEO of a diverse company, as well as a football fan, absolutely unacceptable."

Why did European nations ditch 'OneLove armband' in Qatar?
The 'OneLove armband' seeks to boost diversity and inclusion and was set to be worn in the FIFA World Cup host country Qatar where homosexuality is illegal. However, countries like England, Wales, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and Denmark decided against wearing it due to fear of sanction. In a joint statement, the seven football associations said that they could not put their players 'in a position where they could face sporting sanctions'. 

Meanwhile, FIFA, on the other hand, issued a statement which said that the captains of all teams can wear an armband with the 'No Discrimination' slogan from the quarter-finals stage. "For FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA," Article 13.8.1 of the FIFA Equipment Regulations states.

            Shraddha Walkar murder: Earlier case closed in 2020 after she withdrew complaint against Aaftab Poonawala, says Maharashtra Police
            In 2020, Shraddha Walkar had made a complaint at the Tulinj Police Station in Maharashtra`s Palghar, in which she stated that Aaftab Poonawala, had beaten her and threatened to kill her. She later gave a written statement that there is no dispute.Palghar (Maharashtra): Maharashtra Police on Wednesday said that based on a complaint by Shraddha Walkar in 2020, they had begun an investigation but the case was closed after she gave a written statement to withdraw the case. DCP of Mira Bhayandar-Vasai Virar (MBVV) Commissionerate, Suhas Bavache said that Shraddha in her written statement had stated that "the dispute between herself and Aaftab Poonawala was resolved." "Whatever necessary action had to be taken in that matter was done by police at that time. The application that was given by the complainant was also investigated. After the investigation, the complainant herself gave a written statement that there is no dispute. Her friend`s parents also cajoled her to resolve the dispute. She gave the written statement and after that the case was closed," said Bawche. 

            Aaftab has been accused of strangling to death his alleged live-in partner Shraddha and chopping her body into pieces. He is also alleged to have preserved the chopped body parts in a refrigerator before dumping them in the forests of south Delhi`s Chhatarpur.The Maharashtra Police said that in the year 2020, Shraddha had made a complaint at the Tulinj Police Station in Maharashtra`s Palghar, in which she stated that Aaftab Poonawala, had beaten her and threatened to kill her. The Maharashtra police have confirmed that the deceased had written a complaint letter on November 23, 2020 to the Tulinj police station. 

            In the complaint letter, Shraddha said that she "did not have the guts to go to the police" because Aaftab had threatened to kill her. However, she added that Aaftab tried to kill her on the day she was writing the letter, and he also threatened to cut her into pieces and throw her away. "It`s been six months he has been hitting me," the letter read. The letter further claimed that Aaftab`s parents were aware that he beat her up and that he attempted to kill her." 
            
            I lived with him till date as we were supposed to get married anytime soon and had the blessings of his family. Henceforth, I am not willing to live with him. So any kind of physical damage should be considered coming from him as he has been blackmailing me to kill me or hurt me whenever he sees me anywhere," Shraddha`s complaint alleged.

            Aaftab was produced before the Saket court in the national capital on Tuesday after his five-day police custody expired. "What happened that happened in heat of the moment," Aaftab told the court. A court-sanctioned polygraph test on Aaftab was initiated yesterday. Assistant Director of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Rohini, Sanjeev Gupta said the process of conducting a polygraph test on Aaftab has begun and the report will be out in a week`s time.
            
            Delhi Police had previously said Aaftab, following his arrest in the case, confessed to killing his live-in partner Shraddha in their apartment in West Delhi`s Chhatarpur and to chopping her body into 35 pieces. Aaftab and Shraddha met on a dating site and moved in together to a rented accommodation in Chhatarpur as the relationship grew. On receipt of the complaint from Shraddha`s father, Delhi Police registered an FIR on November 10.

            Ukraine promised to create shelters with heat and water and encouraged citizens to conserve energy as a harsh winter loomed amid relentless Russian strikes that have left its power structure in tatters.
            Power supplies

* The head of Ukraine’s national power grid operator said the damage dealt to power-generating facilities by Russian missile attacks was “colossal” but he dismissed the need to evacuate civilians.

* Special “invincibility centres” will be set up around Ukraine to provide electricity, heat, water, internet, mobile phone connections and pharmacy service, free of charge and around the clock, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.
“The enemy does not stop shelling the positions of our troops and settlements near the contact line (in the Donetsk region),” the Ukrainian military said.

* Russian missiles hit a maternity hospital in the Zaporizhzhia region killing a baby, the regional governor said on the Telegram messaging service.
Foreign Response, Aid

* The Group of Seven nations should soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year, a senior U.S. Treasury official said.

* Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany must be ready for the situation in Ukraine to escalate but that his recent trip to China was worthwhile if only for spelling out the German and Chinese joint stance against using nuclear weapons.

            Jio on Wednesday announced that Jio True 5G will be available in Pune from today. The leading telecom company said Punekars will have an Internet speed of up to 1 gigabits per second (Gbps) with unlimited 5G data. Jio in a statement released on Wednesday said it begins beta testing of its True 5G network in a city only when a large part of the city is covered by its standalone True 5G network, so that Jio customers get good coverage and experience the most advanced Jio 5G network.

Commenting on this announcement, a Jio spokesperson said, "Post the launch of Jio True 5G in 12 cities, a large number of Jio users have enrolled into the Jio Welcome Offer, thereby helping Jio with customer and service feedback to create what will be the most advanced 5G (fifth-generation mobile system) network anywhere in the world."

The spokesperson said as expected, the data usage on Jio's True 5G network was many-a-times higher than the current data consumed on Jio's 4G network.Pune is known for its large student population and as a leading IT hub as well as one of the most important automobile and manufacturing hubs in India. The telecom company said Jio True 5G would be a true game-changer for Punekars.

"What stands out is that this data experience is being delivered at breakneck speeds ranging anywhere between 500 Mbps to 1 Gbps and at extremely low latency that enables use-cases across various verticals that only a True 5G network can bring to life," the spokesperson added.

The leading telecom company said starting from November 23, Jio users in Pune will be invited to the Jio Welcome Offer, to experience unlimited data at up to 1 Gbps speeds, at no additional cost.Reliance Jio Infocomm, doing business as Jio, is an Indian telecommunications company and a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, headquartered in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

Reliance Jio last Friday announced that it is the only operator to provide its 5G services — True-5G —
— across the Delhi-NCR region, including Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and other major locations. The telecom firm said it was rolling out the most-advanced True-5G network at a rapid pace and was covering major parts of this geography.
